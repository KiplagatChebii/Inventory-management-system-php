## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a practical Inventory Management System while developing strong fundamentals in front-end and back-end web development.

Rather than focusing on frameworks first, this project emphasizes:
- Clean structure
- Core language concepts
- Progressive improvement
- Real-world problem modeling
## What I Am Learning

Through this project, I am strengthening:

### Front-End
- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS layout, styling, and responsiveness
- JavaScript fundamentals (DOM manipulation, events, logic)

### Back-End
- PHP fundamentals
- Laravel basics (routing, controllers, views)
- Basic CRUD operations
- Connecting front-end interfaces to back-end logic

### Development Practices
- Version control with Git and GitHub
- Writing clear commit messages
- Incremental feature development
- Code refactoring for readability and maintainability

## How the Project Evolves
This project is intentionally developed in small, incremental steps.

- Features are added gradually
- Code is refactored as concepts improve
- Early implementations may be simple and later improved
- Commit history reflects learning progress and design decisions

This approach mirrors real-world software development, where systems evolve over time.
